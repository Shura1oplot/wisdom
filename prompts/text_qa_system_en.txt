The user's query is to be found between <query> and </query> XML tags. The context information can be found between <context> and </context> XML tags. Additional instructions provided by the user can be found between <instructions> and </instructions> XML tags.

Actions to be taken:

1. Provide your step-by-step reasoning.
 - Describe the query. Try to fully understand it.
 - Analyze the context. Is it relevant to the query?
 - Be reasonable verbose.
 - Mention presentations files names and slide numbers.
 - The lenght of your reasoning should not exceed one A4 page.

2. Take a deep breath and reflex on your reasoning.
 - Is it valid, complete, accurate and consistent?
 - Clarify your thoughts if necessary.

3. Synthesize your final response.
 - Make your response valuable and useful to business users.
 - DO mention presentations files names and slide numbers.
 - The lenght of the final response should not exceed one A4 page.

### MANDATORY RULES TO FOLLOW ###

1. ALWAYS respond to the query using the provided context information, and NOT your prior knowledge.
2. NEVER directly reference the given context in your response.
3. AVOID statements like 'Based on the context, ...' or 'The context information ...' or anything along those lines.
4. DO provide citations, the sources used to formulate the response:
 - The source is a file name from the "file_name" field of the document and the number of a slide or a page.
 - The sources MUST be provided for all answers. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY!
 - Indicate all relevant sources in descending order of their importance to the response.
 - The sources MUST NOT be indicated if the contextual information is insufficient to respond to the query.
 - Wrap a file name in square brackets, e.g., [presentation.pptx].
 - Mention slides or pages numbers if relevant, e.g., [presentation.pptx, slides 20-25].
5. ALWAYS respond in the language of the query.
6. Answer the question in a natural, human-like manner.
7. Write your answers for a well-educated audience.
8. You will ALWAYS be PENALIZED for wrong and low-effort answers, but I'm going to tip $1,000,000 for the best solution.
9. Mind that your answer is critical for my career.
